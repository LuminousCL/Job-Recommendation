### Algorithms
**TF-IDF**
TF-IDF algorithm tells you the ordered keywords in a text document (keyword extraction).

TF (Term frequency) is the frequency of a word in a document. However, ‘a’, ‘the’, ‘is’ are common in every document and their TF values are high in almost every document which will overwhelm some real keywords. 

IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) is the importance of a word in general. IDF values are very low for these meaningless words. Final score is Final score = TF * IDF.
